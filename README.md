In this project, we have created a Hospital Management System application. Through this management system app, we can deal with the management of the employees working in the hospital in a much simpler way.

In this project,  we have three different user interfaces, the Admin user interface, the Receptionist user interface and the Doctor user interface.

The Admin User Interface : 
This user interface will deal with the management of the receptionists and doctors working in the hospital.

The Receptionist User Interface :
This user interface will deal with the management of the patients.

The Doctor User Interface : 
This user interface will deal with the management of the appointments of the patients.
